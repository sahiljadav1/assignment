# Practical Example 7: Write a Python program to calculate grades based on percentage using if-else ladder. 


percentage = int(input("Enter the percentage: "))

if percentage >= 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif percentage >= 80:
    grade = 'B'
elif percentage >= 70:
    grade = 'C'
elif percentage >= 60:
    grade = 'D'
elif percentage >= 50:
    grade = 'E'
else:
    grade = 'F'

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
